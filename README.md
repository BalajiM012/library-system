# Library System

## Project Overview
The Library System project is a containerized application that uses MySQL as its database for managing library resources. This project aims to provide a robust backend solution for handling library operations such as book management, user management, and tracking borrow and return processes efficiently.

## Installation
To set up the Library System project on your machine, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd library-system
   ```

2. **Start the services**:
   Use Docker Compose to build and run the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This command will pull the `mysql:8.0` image, create a MySQL container, and set up the necessary environment variables for the database.

## Usage
Once the services are up and running, you can interact with the MySQL database using any MySQL client or through your application code. The database will be accessible via the following credentials:

- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `3306`
- **Database Name**: `library_system`
- **Username**: `user`
- **Password**: `userpassword`

You can connect to the database using a MySQL client or integrate the connection details into your application for database operations.

## Features
- Containerized setup using Docker for easy deployment and management.
- MySQL database for robust data management.
- Configurable database credentials and settings through environment variables.
- Automatic data persistence with Docker volumes.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies as specified in `docker-compose.yml`:

- `mysql:8.0`

Make sure Docker is installed to use the MySQL image correctly.

## Project Structure
The project structure is simply based on the Docker Compose configuration. Below is a brief overview of the main file:

- **docker-compose.yml**: The main configuration file that defines the services, particularly the MySQL database service, including environment variables, container naming, and volume setup for data persistence.

### Docker Compose File Breakdown
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0                      # MySQL image version
    container_name: mysql_container        # Name of the container
    restart: always                        # Restart policy
    environment:                          # Environment variables for MySQL
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: library_system
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: userpassword
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:3306:3306"               # Port mapping for MySQL
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql         # Volume for data persistence

volumes:
  mysql_data:                             # Definition of the volume for MySQL
```

## Conclusion
This Library System project provides a simple yet efficient setup for library management using Dockerized MySQL as the backend. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to raise issues in the project's repository.
